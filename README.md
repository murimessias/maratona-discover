## ðŸ’» About

Project made during the "Maratona Discover" from Rocketseat. The idea was focused on learning basics from HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've decided to use SCSS to implement something new to learn instead of the use of CSS.

All content was made by <a href="https://github.com/maykbrito">Mayk Brito</a>, instructor at <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a>. The main challeng was to create a application of finances where you can make your financial balance including incomes and outcomes.
